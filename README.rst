This repository houses the task code for `Builder`_, a research project on intertemporal choice.

`Tversky`_ is required, as is access to a machine running `Rserve`_ with `adaptive-server`_.

Note that the description of ``@test_quartets`` embedded in the source of ``builder_task`` erroneously omits ``8*7`` from  ``adaptive_delays``.
